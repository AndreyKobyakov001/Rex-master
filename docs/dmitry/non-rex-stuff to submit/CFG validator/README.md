`main/*` = the main stack-based implementation of the CFG validation algorithm. See the README.md for an overview of the project.

`using_returns/*` = an alternate implementation of the validation algorithm which uses return edges within the CFG to test for
valid paths. It isn't fully finished but it seems like it would eventually end up looking very similar to the existing solution...
